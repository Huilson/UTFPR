I am strong. 
I believe in myself. 
Each day is a new opportunity to grow and be a better version of myself. 
Every challenge in my life is an opportunity to learn from. 
I have so much to be grateful for. 
Good things are always coming into my life. 
New opportunities await me at every turn. 
I have the courage to follow my heart. 
Things will unfold at precisely the right time. 
I will be present in all the moments that this day brings.
